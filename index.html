  <p style="text-align: center;">Some stuff about what i'm reading and should be absorbing</p>

  <p style="color: coral;">I started watching Gotham on netflix and it has a really interesting take on Joker's origin, if you knew something about some of the comic book versions, Canon tells us there was 3 seprate Jokers across maybe even 3 decades leading up to Batman year one. Gotham takes liberties on the character it presents us.</p>

  <p>Gotham presents us with the initial inspiration for 3 potential origins of the 3 Jokers which I thought were pretty nifty. the actor who played the character did a really good job of channeling Heath Ledgers Joker from The Dark Knight.</p>
