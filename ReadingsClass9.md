# Html & CSS

> Forms: Creating them and collecting information from users. Search bars to insurance forms.

Form controls: Adding text, making choices, submitting forms(buttons), uploading files,

info is sent in name/value pairs.

Form control gets a name and the corresponding information input is sent to a server

> List, tables and more of the above:

bullet points are sometimes assumed depending on the platform you're using. 

ol/ul { list-style-type: none; } removes points added automatically. although its css, i found it worked when put inline in the html file. (list-style-image: ;)

interactive 'feeling' forms 

controls should be vertically aligned using css

(table, lists, forms) -- specific css properties to control these

> Events:

interactions trigger events --> events trigger code --> code responds to user
