Layouts:

Positioning elements, manipulating the flow accross and around the page.
Creating and adapting the Layout to fit various screen sizes.

Multiple Css files can go on one page.

960-1000px is a good rule of thumb to work with most common screens.

Fixed width or Liquid Layouts.

Float property is revisited (moves content to far left or right, can also be used to make columns

Relative, Absolute and Fixed need to be specified otherwise normal flow)
