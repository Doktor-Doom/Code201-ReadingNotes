# 201 Reading Notes 

> Code 201, following are the notes and essentially journal entries through the duration of 201. I'd be attempting to make things a bit more organised than the last time. I'll be trying to keep it to 4 other pages representing each week of the program. Editing them daily is the plan as I go through It

## July

* [Wk 1 (6-10)](wk1.md)
* [Wk 2 (13-17)](wk2.md)
* [Wk 3 (20-24)]
* [Wk 4 (27-31)]
